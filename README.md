This project aims to give an analysis of the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. We model the
spread of COVID-19 in the United States by modeling COVID-19 cases and deaths in the United States,
as a country, and by modeling the COVID-19 cases and deaths of certain states where COVID-19 has
had a significant impact. We utilize nonlinear regression models, generalized additive models, and linear
splines to understand the rate of spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
